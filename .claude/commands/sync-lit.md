The source files have been edited directly. Compare the current source files against the code blocks in the lit/*.md files to find what changed. Then update the lit/*.md files to match:

1. Update the code blocks to reflect the current source
2. Update the surrounding prose if the behavior or intent changed
3. Do NOT run tangle afterward — the source is the truth right now

If the changes include new functions or sections that don't have a home in an existing lit file, add them to the most appropriate one.
